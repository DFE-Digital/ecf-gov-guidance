Early career teachers are entitled to mentor support throughout their 2-year induction period.

Mentors ensure your early career teachers recieve a high quality induction.

They meet regularly with early career teachers to provide support and feedback.


## Who to choose as a mentor

Choose a mentor who:

* has the skills necessary to provide or arrange mentoring around specific phases and subject areas
* can take prompt, appropriate action if their ECT is having difficulties

This will normally be someone who holds qualified teacher status (QTS).

You can choose a mentor who does not hold QTS as long as they have the necessary skills and knowledge to support an early career teacher. But you should check this decision with your [appropriate body]().

Ideally you should choose someone who is not also the induction tutor for your early career teachers. The 2 roles have separate and different responsibilities.

## What mentors need to do

Read about the role and responsibilities of mentors in section 5 of the [statutory guidance on ECT induction](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/induction-for-early-career-teachers-england).

Share the [guidance for mentors on ECF-based training](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/guidance-for-mentors-how-to-support-ecf-based-training) to help your mentors understand their role.

## Manage mentor time
You should:

* timetable mentor sessions during teaching hours wherever possible
* ensure your mentors have enough time to meet with their early career teachers regularly

Schools recieve funding to cover mentor time off timetable.

## Mentor training

If you use a training provider to deliver your ECF-based training, mentors will be given 36 hours of mentor training over 2 years. 

Every mentor at your school is expected to take part in this training. 

Schools should not send one mentor for training and then expect that mentor to train their colleagues. 

Your provider will have minimum engagement requirements for all the mentors at your school.

If an early career teacher moves schools or withdraws part-way through their induction, their assigned mentor can continue their training as long as they are ready to work with other early career teachers.

## Observing early career teachers

If you use a training provider to deliver your ECF-based training, mentors may be asked to carry out observations. 

This is for professional development purposes and must not be used for formal assessment.

## Handling mentorsâ€™ concerns and difficulties

If a mentor has concerns or difficulties, they should contact your school [induction tutor](nominate-induction-tutor).

Talk to your [appropriate body]() if a mentor does not have the time or ability to carry out their role effectively.
