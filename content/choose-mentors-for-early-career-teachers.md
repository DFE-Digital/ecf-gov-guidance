To set up training for your early career teachers, you need to arrange mentoring for them.

Early career teachers are entitled to mentor support throughout their 2-year induction period.

^There are also other steps to [set up training for your early career teachers](/set-up-training-for-your-early-career-teachers).^

## What mentors do

Mentors ensure your early career teachers receive a high quality induction.

They meet regularly with early career teachers to provide support and feedback.

They also take prompt, appropriate action if their early career teacher is experiencing difficulties.

Read about the role and responsibilities of mentors in section 5 of the [statutory guidance on induction for early career teachers](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/induction-for-early-career-teachers-england).

Share the [guidance for mentors](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/guidance-for-mentors-how-to-support-ecf-based-training) to help your mentors understand their role.


## Who to choose as a mentor

Choose mentors who have the skills to provide mentoring around specific phases and subject areas.

This will normally be someone who holds qualified teacher status (QTS).

If you choose someone who does not have QTS, you should check this decision with your [appropriate body](/appoint-an-appropriate-body-early-career-teachers).

Try to choose someone who is not also the [induction tutor](/nominate-induction-tutor) for your early career teachers. The 2 roles have separate and different responsibilities.

## Manage mentor time

Timetable mentor sessions during teaching hours wherever possible.

Ensure your mentors have enough time to meet with their early career teachers regularly.

Schools receive [funding](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/funding-and-eligibility-for-ecf-based-training) to cover mentor time off timetable.

## Mentor training and observations

If you use a training provider to deliver [training for your early career teachers](/choose-training-option-early-career-teachers), mentors will be given 36 hours of mentor training over 2 years. 

Every mentor at your school is expected to take part in this training. 

Your provider will have minimum engagement requirements for all the mentors at your school.

If an early career teacher moves schools or withdraws part-way through their induction, their assigned mentor can continue their training as long as they are ready to work with other early career teachers.

Mentors may also be asked to observe your early career teachers.

This is for professional development purposes and must not be used for formal assessment.

## Registering mentors

Your [induction tutor](/nominate-induction-tutor) needs to register mentors through the 'Manage training for early careers teachers' service.

If your school is new to this service, [send your school a link to use the service](https://manage-training-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/nominations/resend-email).

You'll be asked to nominate an induction tutor, who will then be given access to the service.

Once set up, your induction tutor can [sign in to 'Manage training for early career teachers'](https://manage-training-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/) to register mentors.


## Handling mentorsâ€™ concerns

If a mentor has concerns or difficulties, they should contact your school [induction tutor](/nominate-induction-tutor).

Talk to your [appropriate body](/appoint-an-appropriate-body-early-career-teachers) if a mentor does not have the time or ability to carry out their role effectively.
