To set up training for your early career teachers, you need to nominate an induction tutor.

^There are also other steps to [set up training for your early career teachers](/set-up-training-for-your-early-career-teachers).^

## What induction tutors do

Induction tutors monitor and support your early career teachers.

They conduct:

* regular progress reviews
* 2 formal assessment meetings with early career teachers during the 2-year induction period - one midway through induction and one at the end

Read about the roles and responsibilities of induction tutors in section 5 of the [statutory guidance on induction for early career teachers](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/induction-for-early-career-teachers-england).

They also need to report certain information about your early career training through '[Manage training for early careers teachers](https://manage-training-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/)'.

For example, they'll need to give details about your [mentors](/choose-mentors-for-early-career-teachers), early career teachers and your chosen [training option](/choose-training-option-early-career-teachers/).

## Who to nominate

Choose someone who:

* holds qualified teacher status (QTS)
* can assess early career teachers' progress against the teachers’ standards

Try to choose someone who is not also a mentor for your early career teachers. The 2 roles have separate and different responsibilities.

You can only have one induction tutor for your school.

## Nominate your induction tutor

Nominate your induction tutor through ‘Manage training for early careers teachers’.

If your school is new to the service, [send your school a link to use the service](https://manage-training-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/nominations/resend-email).

Once you've nominated an induction tutor, they'll be invited to sign in to ‘[Manage training for early careers teachers](https://manage-training-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/)’ to report information about your training.
