Induction tutors monitor and support your early career teachers.

They also manage progress reviews and coordinate formal assessments.

## Who to nominate

Choose someone who:

* holds qualified teacher status (QTS)
* can assess early career teachers' progress against the teachers’ standards

Ideally you should choose someone who is not also a mentor for your early career teachers. The 2 roles have separate and different responsibilities.

## What induction tuturs need to do

They need to:

* carry out regular progress reviews
* undertake 2 formal assessment meetings with early career teachers during the 2-year induction period - one midway through induction and one at the end
* recognise when early action is needed if an early career teacher is experiencing difficulties

Read more about the roles and responsibilities of an induction tutor in section 5 of the [statutory guidance for the induction for early career teachers](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/induction-for-early-career-teachers-england).

Induction tutors are also the key point of contact with the Department for Education, regarding your early career programme.



## Point of contact with the Department for Education

Your school must nominate an induction tutor to be our point of contact. This person is given access to our manage training for early career teachers service. Currently you can only nominate one induction tutor at a time.

If your school has not registered an induction tutor with us before, request a link so you can nominate a new induction tutor.

If you want to change to a new induction tutor, your current induction tutor can sign in to our service to nominate someone else to be the induction tutor. This will transfer access to your school’s account to the new induction tutor.

If you’re not sure if you have registered an induction tutor or an induction tutor has left your school without nominating a new induction tutor, email our support team at continuing-professional-development@digital.education.gov.uk.
