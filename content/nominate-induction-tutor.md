Induction tutors monitor and support your early career teachers.

They manage progress reviews and coordinate formal assessments.

They also need to report certain information about your early career programme to the Department for Education.

## Who to nominate

Choose someone who:

* holds qualified teacher status (QTS)
* can assess early career teachers' progress against the teachersâ€™ standards
* is not also a mentor for your early career teachers, ideally

## What induction tutors need to do

They need to:

* carry out regular progress reviews
* undertake 2 formal assessment meetings with early career teachers during the 2-year induction period - one midway through induction and one at the end
* recognise when early action is needed if an early career teacher is experiencing difficulties

Your induction tutor will need also access to the 'Manage training for early careers teachers' service in order to report information about your early career programme to the Department for Education.

If your school is new to this service, [send your school a link to use the service](https://manage-training-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/nominations/resend-email).

You'll be asked to nominate an induction tutor. They can then [sign in to 'Manage training for early career teachers'](https://manage-training-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/).



^This is useful information that's worth knowing.^
