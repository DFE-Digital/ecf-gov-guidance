To set up training for your early career teachers, you need to nominate an induction tutor.

^There are also other steps to [set up training for your early career teachers](/set-up-training-for-your-early-career-teachers).^

## What induction tutors do

Induction tutors monitor and support your early career teachers.

They conduct:

* regular progress reviews
* 2 formal assessment meetings with early career teachers during the 2-year induction period - one midway through induction and one at the end

Read about the roles and responsibilities of induction tutors in section 5 of the [statutory guidance on induction for early career teachers](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/induction-for-early-career-teachers-england).

They also need to report certain information about your training for early career teachers to the Department for Education (DfE) so that your school receives the correct funding to support induction and training.

For example, they'll need to give details about your [mentors](/choose-mentors-for-early-career-teachers), early career teachers and your chosen [training option](/choose-training-option-early-career-teachers/).

To enable them to do this, nominate your induction tutor.

## Nominate your induction tutor

If you've never nominated an induction tutor before, [send your school a link to use 'Manage training for early career teachers'](https://manage-training-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/nominations/resend-email).

You'll receive an email to your school's email address as recorded in the Get Information about Schools (GIAS) register. You'll be asked to confirm whether early career teachers are starting and to nominate an induction tutor. 

Once you've done this, your induction tutor will be invited to sign in to ‘[Manage training for early careers teachers](https://manage-training-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/)’ to report information about your training.

If you've had induction tutors before, they can sign in to 'Manage training for early career teachers' to change the induction tutor.

## Who to nominate

Choose someone who:

* holds qualified teacher status (QTS)
* can assess early career teachers' progress against the teachers’ standards

Schools commonly choose someone in a senior leadership position such as an assistant head.

Try to choose someone who is not also a mentor for your early career teachers. The 2 roles have separate and different responsibilities.

You can only have one induction tutor for your school.
