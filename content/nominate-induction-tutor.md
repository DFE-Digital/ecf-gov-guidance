To set up training for your early career teachers, you need to nominate an induction tutor for every early career teacher.

You can use the same induction tutor for all of your early career teachers.

^There are also other steps to [set up training for your early career teachers](/set-up-training-for-your-early-career-teachers).^

## What induction tutors do

Induction tutors monitor and support your early career teachers. 

They need to recognise when early action is needed if an early career teacher is experiencing difficulties.

Responsibilities include:

* carrying out regular progress reviews
* undertaking 2 formal assessment meetings with early career teachers during the 2-year induction period - one midway through induction and one at the end

Read about the roles and responsibilities of induction tutors in section 5 of the [statutory guidance on induction for early career teachers](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/induction-for-early-career-teachers-england).

They also need to report certain information about your early career training using the 'Manage training for early careers teachers' service.

If your school is new to this service, [send your school a link to use the service](https://manage-training-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/nominations/resend-email).

You'll be asked to nominate an induction tutor. They can then [sign in to 'Manage training for early career teachers'](https://manage-training-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/).




## Who to nominate

Choose someone who:

* holds qualified teacher status (QTS)
* can assess early career teachers' progress against the teachersâ€™ standards

Try to choose someone who is not also a mentor for your early career teachers. The 2 roles have separate and different responsibilities.
