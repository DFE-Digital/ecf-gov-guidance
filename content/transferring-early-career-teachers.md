If an early career teacher transfers to or away from your school during their 2-year induction period, you need to report the transfer to:

* your [appropriate body](/appoint-an-appropriate-body-early-career-teachers) for that early career teacher
* the Department for Education

Your induction tutor also needs to report the transfer to the Department for Education (DfE) to ensure both schools receive the correct funding.

[Learn about induction tutors and how they report information to DfE](/nominate-induction-tutor).

If the early career teacher is transferring to your school, ask them or their previous school for records of any assessments and progress reviews completed so far.

Early career teachers should continue with their existing training programme if possible.

If this is not possible, you’ll need to make arrangements for them to continue their training with a different lead provider or using a different [training option](/choose-training-option-early-career-teachers).

Discuss this with your:

* appropriate body for that early career teacher
* lead provider, if you’ll use one

You should also talk to the early career teacher's previous lead provider if they had one.
