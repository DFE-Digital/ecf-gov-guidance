If an early career teacher transfers to or away from your school during their 2-year induction period, you need to report to transfer to:

* your [appropriate body](/appoint-an-appropriate-body-early-career-teachers) for that early career teacher
* the Department for Education

Your induction tutor can report this to the Department for Education through ‘[Manage training for early career teachers](https://manage-training-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/)’. This ensures both schools receive the correct funding.

[Find out about induction tutors](/nominate-induction-tutor), including and how to sign in to ‘Manage training for early career teachers’.

If the early career teacher is transferring to your school, ask them or their previous school for records of any assessments and progress reviews completed so far.

Early career teachers should continue with their existing training programme if possible.

If this is not possible, you’ll need to make arrangements for them to continue their training with a different provider or using a different [training option](/choose-training-option-early-career-teachers).

Discuss this with your:

* appropriate body for that early career teacher
* provider, if you’ll use one

You should also talk to the previous provider for that early career teacher, if their previous school used one.
