Sign into the manage training for early career teachers service to tell us as soon as you know an ECT will be:

* transferring to your school part-way through their induction
* transferring away from your school part-way through their induction

We need this information so both schools receive the correct funding.

## What to do when an ECT transfers to your school

Report the transfer to the appropriate body you’ve appointed for the ECT. They’ll need to complete some checks and update the ECT’s record with the Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA).

Ask the ECT or their previous school to provide records of any assessments and progress reviews completed so far.

## How to continue an ECT’s training

ECTs should continue with their existing ECF-based training programme if at all possible.

Where this is not possible, you’ll need to make arrangements for the ECT to continue their ECF-based training with a different training provider or by another delivery method.

You should discuss these arrangements with:

* the appropriate body you have appointed for them
* your lead provider, if you’ll use a training provider to continue their training
* their previous lead provider, if their old school used a training provider to deliver their training
