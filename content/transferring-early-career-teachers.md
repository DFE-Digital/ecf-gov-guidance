Sign into the '[Manage training for early career teachers](https://manage-training-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/)' service to report that an early career teacher is:

* transferring to your school part-way through their induction
* transferring away from your school part-way through their induction

This is so that both schools receive the correct funding.

You also need to report the transfer to the appropriate body you’ve appointed for the early career teacher. 

Ask the early career teacher or their previous school to provide records of any assessments and progress reviews completed so far.

Early career teachers should continue with their existing training programme if at all possible.

Where this is not possible, you’ll need to make arrangements for them to continue their training with a different training provider or by another delivery method.

You should discuss these arrangements with:

* the appropriate body you have appointed for them
* your lead provider, if you’ll use a training provider to continue their training
* their previous lead provider, if their old school used a training provider to deliver their training
