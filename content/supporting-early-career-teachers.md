You should ensure early career teachers can participate fully in their training but failing to complete the training does not mean they fail their induction.

## Help early career teachers understand their training

Share the [guidance for early career teachers](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/guidance-for-early-career-teachers-ects-ecf-based-training).

## Expectations for early career teachers

Find out about the expectations for early career teachers in section 5 of the [statutory guidance on induction for early career teachers](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/induction-for-early-career-teachers-england).

If you're using a training provider to deliver your training, your early career teachers need to meet the provider's requirements. 

If they do not, they could be withdrawn from the provider's programme and you would need to set up another training programme. 

[Find out about your training options](/choose-training-option-early-career-teachers).

## Handling concerns

If early career teachers have problems with their training, they should talk to your [induction tutor](/nominate-induction-tutor) for help. They can also speak to their training provider if you use one.

If they have concerns about their statutory entitlements to time off timetable and mentor support, they should talk to your induction tutor first. If your induction tutor cannot help, they can speak to your [appropriate body](/appoint-an-appropriate-body-early-career-teachers).

You need to give your early career teachers the contact details of a named person at your appropriate body when they start their induction.

## Reduced or part time inductions

If your early career teachers are serving a reduced or part time induction period, they do not need to cover the full depth of the early career framework. 

Work with your [induction tutor](/nominate-induction-tutor), training provider (if you use one) and your [appropriate body](/appoint-an-appropriate-body-early-career-teachers) to ensure training and support is appropriate.
