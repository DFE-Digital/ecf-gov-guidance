ECTs should participate in ECF-based training as fully as possible, although failing to complete it does not mean they fail their induction.

You can share the [guidance for early career teachers](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/guidance-for-early-career-teachers-ects-ecf-based-training) to help them understand how the training works.

You can also read about the expectations for early career teachers in section 5 of the [statutory guidance on induction for early career teachers](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/induction-for-early-career-teachers-england).

## Part-time induction and reduced induction periods

If your school uses a training provider, contact your lead provider for their policies on part-time induction and reduced induction periods. You will also need to ask the ECT’s appropriate body to agree to any reduction to their induction period.

If your school uses accredited materials or designs and delivers its own training, contact your appropriate body for advice on part-time induction and reduced induction periods.

When an ECT is serving a reduced induction period, there’s no expectation that they should cover the full depth of the ECF. Your headteacher should work with your induction tutor, appropriate body and training provider (where relevant) to make sure training and support is appropriate for the ECT.

## ECT engagement with training provider programmes

If your school uses a training provider, the lead provider will have minimum requirements for ECT engagement. This is to make sure ECTs receive their statutory entitlement to ECF-based training.

If an ECT cannot meet those engagement requirements, they may be withdrawn from the programme by the lead provider. If this happens, your school may have to provide them with alternative ECF-based training.

## Handling ECTs’ concerns and difficulties

If an ECT is struggling with their training, they should ask their induction tutor for help. If your school is using a training provider, they can speak to them too.

When an ECT has concerns about their induction or statutory entitlements (time off timetable and support from a mentor), they should speak to your school induction tutor first.

If your induction tutor is unable to help, the ECT can speak to their appropriate body. ECTs must be given the contact details of a named person at the appropriate body at the start of their induction.
