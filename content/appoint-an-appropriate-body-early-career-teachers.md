To set up training for your early career teachers, you need to appoint an appropriate body for each early career teacher.

^There are also other steps to [set up training for your early career teachers](/set-up-training-for-your-early-career-teachers).^

## What an appropriate body does

Appropriate bodies quality assure induction. They:

* confirm each ECT’s role is suitable to count towards their statutory induction
* register each ECT’s induction with the Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA)
* check your ECTs receive their statutory entitlements
* make sure formal assessments are fair and appropriate

If your school delivers training using accredited materials or designs and delivers your own training, your appropriate body will check that the training is based on the ECF. This process is known as ‘fidelity checking’. Schools using a DfE-funded training provider will not need to have these checks.

Most schools appoint one appropriate body for all their ECTs, but you can appoint a different appropriate body:

* as a choice for a new ECT, or group of ECTs, due to start induction
* when an ECT did their initial teacher training (ITT) through an accredited provider who cannot then be the appropriate body assuring their induction
* where an ECT is serving their induction in a teaching school hub or appropriate body, who cannot also be the appropriate body assuring their induction
