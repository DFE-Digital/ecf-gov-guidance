To set up training for your early career teachers, you need to appoint an appropriate body.

^There are also other steps to [set up training for your early career teachers](/set-up-training-for-your-early-career-teachers).^

## What an appropriate body does

Appropriate bodies quality assure induction. 

For example, they:

* confirm that an early career teacher's role is suitable to count towards their statutory induction
* check your early career teachers receive their statutory entitlements
* make sure formal assessments are fair and appropriate

Unless you use a training provider to deliver [training for your early career teachers](/choose-training-option-early-career-teachers)), your appropriate body will also check that your training covers the full depth of the [early career framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-career-framework).

## Find an appropriate body


[Find an appropriate body](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/statutory-teacher-induction-appropriate-bodies/find-an-appropriate-body).


You can appoint one appropriate body for all of your early career teachers, but you may need or choose to appoint different ones.

For example - if an early career teacher did their initial teacher training (ITT) through an accredited provider who is also an appropriate body, you cannot appoint that appropriate body for that teacher.

If an early career teacher is serving their induction at an appropriate body (such as a teaching school hub), you cannot appoint that appropriate body for that teacher.
