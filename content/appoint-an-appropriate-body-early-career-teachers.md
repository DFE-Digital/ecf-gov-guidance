To set up training for your early career teachers, you need to appoint an appropriate body. 

Early career teachers cannot start their induction until you’ve appointed one.

^There are also other steps to [set up training for your early career teachers](/set-up-training-for-your-early-career-teachers).^

## What an appropriate body does

Appropriate bodies quality assure induction. 

For example, they:

* check that your early career teachers receive their statutory entitlements, such as [mentoring](/choose-mentors-for-early-career-teachers) throughout their 2 year induction period
* make sure formal assessments conducted by your [induction tutor](/nominate-induction-tutor) are fair and appropriate

Unless you use a training provider to deliver [training for your early career teachers](/choose-training-option-early-career-teachers), your appropriate body will also check that your training covers the full depth of the [early career framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-career-framework). 

[Read more about the role and responsibilities of appropriate bodies](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appropriate-bodies-guidance-induction-and-the-early-career-framework).

Your appropriate body can also give advice if your early career teachers are serving a reduced or part time induction. They'll need to agree to any reduction to the induction period.

## Appoint an appropriate body

[Find an appropriate body](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/statutory-teacher-induction-appropriate-bodies/find-an-appropriate-body) and contact them to appoint them.

## Who you can and cannot appoint 

You can appoint one appropriate body for all of your early career teachers, but you may need or choose to appoint different ones.

You may have previously used a local authority as an appropriate body for early career teachers. From September 2023 you cannot use a local authority for new inductions, so you'll need to choose another appropriate body for any new early career teachers.

If an early career teacher did their initial teacher training (ITT) through an accredited ITT provider who is also an appropriate body, you cannot appoint that appropriate body for that teacher.

Early career teachers may be serving their induction at an appropriate body. For example, they may work at a teaching school hub which is also an appropriate body. If this is the case, you cannot appoint that appropriate body for that teacher.

Learn more about who you can and cannot appoint in section 2 of the [statutory guidance on induction for early career teachers](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/induction-for-early-career-teachers-england).
