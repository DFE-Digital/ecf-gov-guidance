After you [choose a training option for your early career teachers](/choose-training-option-early-career-teachers), there may be occasions where you need to make changes.

Ensure any changes are right for your early career teachers and mentors.

Plan any changes for the end of a school year if possible.

## Change provider

If you have concerns regarding your training provider, discuss this directly with them.

Let the provider know if you decide to end the partnership.

You'll receive an email from them confirming the end of the partnership.

Forward this on to the Department for Education at continuing-professional-development@digital.education.gov.uk. 

Once you've instructed a new provider, your new provider will report the partnership to the Department for Education.

## Change delivery partner

If you have concerns regarding your delivery partner, discuss this directly with them.

If you decide to change to another delivery partner, confirm the change with your provider.

Your provider will report the change to the Department for Education. 

## Change training option

### If you use a provider

If you want to switch from using a training provider to another [training option](/choose-training-option-early-career-teachers), discuss this directly with your provider.

Let the provider know if you decide to change your training option.

You'll receive an email from them confirming the end of the partnership.

Forward this on to the Department for Education at continuing-professional-development@digital.education.gov.uk.

You'll receive an email from the Department for Education asking you to confirm your new training option.

### If you use DfE-accredited materials

Your early career teachers and mentors may lose their progress if you change your programme.

Email the Department for Education at continuing-professional-development@digital.education.gov.uk to:

* change training materials
* switch to using a training provider
* report that you want to design and deliver your own training

### If you design and deliver your own training

You do not need to tell the Department for Education if you redesign your programme.

Your [appropriate body](/appoint-an-appropriate-body-early-career-teachers) will  check your programme to make sure it covers the early career framework.

To change from your own training programme to another delivery method, your induction tutor should report the change through '[Manage training for early career teachers](https://manage-training-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/)'.
